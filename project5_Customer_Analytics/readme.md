# üß† Customer Analytics Project

## üìä Introduction

In today‚Äôs data-driven market, understanding customer behavior is critical for improving user experience, increasing engagement, and driving business growth. **Customer Analytics** involves collecting, processing, and analyzing customer data to gain insights into purchasing patterns, segmentation, churn prediction, and targeting strategies.

This end-to-end project showcases a complete machine learning workflow that helps businesses:
- Understand customer behavior using **exploratory data analysis**
- Handle **imbalanced data** with SMOTE
- Train and evaluate various **ML and deep learning models**
- Perform **customer segmentation** using clustering
- Log and track models using **MLflow**
- Build a web interface using **Gradio**
- Containerize the app using **Docker**
- Integrate with **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD

---

## üß™ Objective

Build a production-ready pipeline for customer analytics that:
1. Predicts customer behavior using multiple ML models
2. Handles class imbalance with oversampling
3. Segments customers using clustering techniques
4. Deploys the model via a user-friendly Gradio interface
5. Supports containerization and version tracking

## üöÄ Project Pipeline

### 1. **Data Preparation**
- Loaded dataset
- Data cleaning & feature engineering

> Churn: `1 = Yes`, `0 = No` ‚Äî imbalance addressed using **SMOTE**

---

### 2. **Baseline Model Training**
- Logistic Regression
- XGBoost
- Evaluated using Confusion Matrix & AUC-ROC

### 3. **Handling Imbalance with SMOTE**
- Applied SMOTE
- Re-trained Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Compared model performance before/after balancing

### 4. **Neural Network Modeling**
- Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN) using Keras
- Trained on balanced dataset

### 5. **Customer Segmentation**
- K-Means (Elbow Method & Silhouette Score)
- DBSCAN
- Optimal clusters comparison

### 6. **Model Logging with MLflow**
- Logged all models and hyperparameters
- Compared models using MLflow UI

### 7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
- GridSearchCV (Sklearn models)
- KerasTuner (FFNN)
- Best model registered in MLflow

### 8. **Gradio Web App**
- Built an interactive UI using Gradio
- Integrated model predictions
- Logged app artifact in MLflow

üì∏ [Gradio UI](https://github.com/Aparna10010/Machine-Learning/blob/main/project5_Customer_Analytics/Gradio%20UI.png)

### 9. **Docker Containerization**
- Dockerized the entire app
- `Dockerfile` included
- Currently debugging container execution issue

---

### 10. **CI/CD Integration (GitHub Actions)**

Integrated GitHub Actions to automate testing and container build on code push. Status:

| CI/CD Feature        | Status         |
|----------------------|----------------|
| Workflow Setup       | ‚úîÔ∏è Completed   |
| Python Setup         | ‚ùå Failed initially (wrong version `3.1`) |
| Dependency install   | ‚úîÔ∏è Successful  |
| Docker build         | ‚ùå Under debugging |
| CI pipeline          | üöß In progress |

> GitHub Actions config created and tested multiple times. Workflow reaches Docker build step, but fails due to local path issues and unavailable `.tar.gz` packages. Debugging continues.
