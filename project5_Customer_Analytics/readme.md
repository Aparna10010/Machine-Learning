# üß† Customer Analytics Project

## üìå Overview

**Customer Analytics** is a critical component of modern business intelligence. It involves gathering, processing, and analyzing customer data to understand behavior, segment users, and predict future actions. This helps businesses make data-driven decisions, personalize marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and ultimately increase revenue.

This end-to-end project focuses on building a robust **Customer Analytics system** using machine learning and deep learning. It covers the complete data science lifecycle:

* Data preprocessing and visualization
* Model training and evaluation (before and after class balancing)
* Clustering for customer segmentation
* Neural network modeling
* Model logging with MLflow
* App deployment using Gradio
* Containerization using Docker
* CI/CD setup using GitHub Actions

---

## üß™ Problem Statement

Businesses often struggle with understanding and predicting customer behavior due to:

* Imbalanced datasets
* Lack of robust segmentation
* Ineffective model tracking and deployment

This project solves these problems by:

* Implementing class balancing techniques (SMOTE)
* Using ML and DL models for prediction
* Segmenting customers using clustering algorithms
* Logging and versioning models with MLflow
* Deploying a user-friendly Gradio app
* Enabling containerized deployment (Docker)

## üîÅ Full Pipeline Breakdown

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**

* **Load dataset**
* **Clean and transform data**
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to find hidden patterns
* **Data scaling** and **label encoding**

---

### 2. **Initial Modeling (Baseline Models)**

* Trained models on the **imbalanced dataset** using:

  * Logistic Regression
  * XGBoost
* Evaluated performance using:

  * Accuracy, Precision, Recall
  * Confusion Matrix, AUC-ROC Curve

---

### 3. **Class Imbalance Handling**

* Applied **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)** to balance the dataset
* Re-trained the following models on balanced data:

  * Logistic Regression
  * Decision Tree
  * Random Forest
  * XGBoost
* Evaluated all models and visualized results

---

### 4. **Neural Network Training**

* Built a **Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN)** using Keras
* Trained and evaluated on SMOTE-balanced data
* Visualized metrics and results

---

### 5. **Customer Segmentation**

* Applied **K-Means Clustering** with Elbow Method & Silhouette Score
* Used **DBSCAN** for density-based clustering
* Mapped K-Means clusters to initialize DBSCAN for comparison
* Saved clustering models for reuse

---

### 6. **Model Logging with MLflow**

* Logged all models using a single reusable function
* Included both baseline and SMOTE-trained models
* Tracked model parameters, metrics, and artifacts

---

### 7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**

* Tuned models using grid/randomized search:

  * Logistic Regression
  * Decision Tree
  * Random Forest
  * XGBoost
  * FFNN (using **Keras Tuner**)
* Logged all tuned models in MLflow
* Verified that tuned models gave similar or better accuracy

---

### 8. **Gradio App Deployment**

* Built a **Gradio-based web app** for predictions
* Deployed and launched from local system
* Logged the app interface and interactions in MLflow
* Registered the final model and its version in the MLflow Model Registry
* Implemented CI/CD pipeline using **GitHub Actions** 

---

### 9. **Docker Containerization**

* Created a custom **Dockerfile**
* Packaged the ML pipeline and Gradio app into a Docker container
* Facing minor execution issue with Dockerfile (under resolution)
